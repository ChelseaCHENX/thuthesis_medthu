\section{Introduction}

COPD is a prevalent disease

\section{Method}

Molecular pathology is the expression of a few essential genes which determine disease behavior - e.g., in BC, being hormone receptors (ER, PR, HER2); and Ki67 as proliferation indicator, the expression of which are easily assessed by IHC or IF (immunofluorescence). Positivity is defined differently for each marker - e.g., >=1\% of stained tumor cells for ER or PR while >10\% positive cells for HER2 \citep{fragomeni2018molecular}. ER is a transcription factor (TF) canonically activated by estrogen and is one most essential indicator of endocrine therapy benefits. PR is also a steroid hormone receptor and TF, which can be induced by estrogen and in turn influence ER. Positivity in both ER and PR indicates good prognosis and endocrine responsiveness pathways \citep{lange2008challenges}. HER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) encoded by ERBB2 gene, which when activated, promotes survival, proliferation and invasiveness through activating the PI3K-Akt and Sos-Ras-MAPK pathways \citep{hudis2007trastuzumab}. ERBB2 amplification is detected in 15-30\% of breast cancers, and typically indicates high invasiveness. Anti-HER2 treatment is often suggested - trastuzumab, pertuzumab as monoclonal antibodies (mAb), and small molecules (gefitinib, lapatinib) targeting tyrosine kinase. Ki67 is expressed in active cell cycle, which generally reflects active proliferation and predicts poor outcomes. Chemotherapy is often suggested for tumors with high Ki67 level.
